# customTicTacToe
I made TicTacToe that supports a custom sized board (min. 3, max. 10, this can easily be changed (line 128), but I don't recommend it). Uses tkinter for GUI and expects you to have the fonts Atkinson Hyperlegible (https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) and Monospace installed (this is easy to change). 

If you want to change the fonts:

Line 21 - Monospace

Lines 23, 72, 138, 140 - Atkinson Hyperlegible
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Tic Tac Toe that supports a custom sized board (min. 10, max. 3)
Everyone knows Tic Tac Toe. This script is Tic Tac Toe, but the board can be changed to be any size (currently set to a max. of 10 due to tkinter lag, but this can easily be changed (ln. 136).

Note that if the user chooses to go again, the turn will switch. If X was last to play, then O will start the next game, and vv.

TO-DO (maybe): Have a 2nd gameplay mode where the win line size is 3 no matter what size the board is (currently it's tied to the size of the board).
